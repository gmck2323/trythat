## TryThat

As of right now, this app is more for me to play around and explore how to be a better developer.

Not everything is styled exactly the way I want, this app is still a work in progress!

### Some Questions I Try to Explore are:

Where should I be using React Hooks instead of Redux?

What is the best way to set up controllers for my server?

Are there times that for loops beat out mapping?
